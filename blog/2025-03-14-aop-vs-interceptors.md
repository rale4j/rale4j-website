 # Why AOP Over Interceptors?

   Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) and interceptors are both powerful techniques for adding cross-cutting concerns to your application. However, AOP offers several advantages over interceptors.

   ## Advantages of AOP

   - **Separation of Concerns**: AOP allows you to separate cross-cutting concerns from your business logic, making your code cleaner and more maintainable.
   - **Flexibility**: AOP provides more flexibility in defining pointcuts and advices, allowing you to apply aspects to a wide range of join points.
   - **Reusability**: Aspects can be reused across different parts of your application, reducing code duplication.

   ## Use Cases

   - **Logging**: Use AOP to add logging to your application without cluttering your business logic.
   - **Security**: Implement security checks using AOP to ensure that your application is secure.
   - **Transaction Management**: Manage transactions declaratively with AOP, simplifying your code.

   ## Conclusion

   While interceptors are useful for certain scenarios, AOP provides a more powerful and flexible way to handle cross-cutting concerns in your application. By using AOP, you can keep your code clean, maintainable, and reusable.
